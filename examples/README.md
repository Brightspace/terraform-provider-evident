# Terraform Examples

This directory contains a set of examples of using the Evident provider with Terraform. The examples each have their own README containing more details on what the example does.

To run any example, clone the repository and run `terraform apply` within
the example's own directory.

For example:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Brightspace/terraform-provider-evident
$ cd terraform-provider-evident/examples/basic
$ terraform apply
...
```


The examples do not always include every resource that is necessary for the example to work. The README will cover what is missing or expected to exist for each example.
